# Frontend Plan (Deferred)

## Objective
Build a terminal-style UI after backend stabilization that turns backend intelligence into fast campaign decisions.

## Status
Deferred until backend milestone B5 is accepted.

## UX Pillars
- Decision-first workflow
- Fast situational awareness
- Explainability at point of action
- Role-aware views

## Planned Stack
- Next.js + TypeScript
- API client generated from OpenAPI
- Map-based visualizations for ward-level insights

## Planned Areas
1. Overview Dashboard
2. Geo Heatmap View
3. Segment Analysis
4. Recommendations Feed
5. Alerts Panel
6. Action Tracking UI

## Dependency on Backend
Frontend work starts only after backend API contracts are stable and versioned.
